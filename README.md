# Solution

Very simple implemtation. Data files are in data directory if more is provided they'll be proccessed, currently its only may 05, 06.
After execution 2 csv files will be created one includes all the compaigns and other one creatives
As most of the functions are async they were converted to promises to avoid callback hell
